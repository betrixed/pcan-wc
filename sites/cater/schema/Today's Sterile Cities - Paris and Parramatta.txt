Today's Sterile Cities - Paris and Parramatta

Today, the single greens councillor on Parramatta City Council, Phil Bradley, launched a Campaign for more low-income housing to be provided by PCC, especially in the CBD area. Phil has made the lack of provision of low-income housing, while it is obvious that many new high-rise buildings with living apartments are being built in the CBD. Somebody is making money off them, selling at high prices to owners and landlords, for expensive rents. Some people can still the sorts  Parramatta rents if they are on above average income. I was told by greens activist James Ryan, a income of at least 70,000+ per year, is required for rental costs alone of 30,000+ a year).  Thats about $575.00 a week, a cost that I would consider impossible. Add in electricity, food, water, transport, clothing, medical expenses, and no-one on ordinary sorts of incomes can afford to live within the Parramatta CBD.

From the internet - An air BNB apartment in Parramatta CBD was offered on line for $60 per night. But to rent units on a longer term (on www.domain.com.au), its $450 for a single bedroom, $500 for 2 bedroom, $620 for a 3 bedroom apartment. 
Rental falls for units in suburbs close to Parramatta.
Its $410 median price for 2 bedroom in Merrylands,
$400 in North Parramatta.

Two and half million Australians (13% of the population) live in households experiencing financial stress. Some people simply can’t afford to pay their utility bills – one in four households in fact. The problem affects people who are working as well those who are unemployed.

Unfortunately, the availability of payment plans and hardship programs has not led to fewer customers being disconnected from supply. The Australian Energy Regulator’s disconnection figures released to date show NSW disconnections for 2015/2016 are likely to reach 32,000,

Our casework indicates that complaints about energy or water bills are most often just one aspect of significant family or housing stress. This is echoed in St Vincent de Paul’s (Vinnies) ‘Households in the dark’ report published earlier this year.

“Our research explores residential disconnections across Australia and highlights how industry changes, higher bills and entrenched poverty contribute to NSW’s high disconnection rate,” Vinnies NSW CEO Jack de Groot says.

This suggests governments are facing a ‘cost conundrum’, whereby lower spending on quality social housing leads to higher investment in energy payment assistance and even healthcare. The solution lies in high quality, energy efficient housing stock that uses new technology like renewable energy and smart meters. Encouragingly, energy providers are exploring partnerships with social housing agencies in an effort to bring about change.

Vinnies has thrown a challenge to the government. There are urgently calling for two things – an increase in social housing dwellings and a change to affordable housing planning laws.
